    "# Automatic Speech Recognition with Transducer Models\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a basic tutorial for creating a Transducer ASR model and then training it on a small dataset (AN4). It includes discussion relevant to reducing memory issues when training such models and demonstrates how to change the decoding strategy after training. Finally, it also provides a brief glimpse of extracting alignment information from a trained Transducer model.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see in this tutorial, apart from the differences in the config and the class used to instantiate the model, nearly all steps are precisely similar to any CTC-based model training. Many concepts such as data loader setup, optimization setup, pre-trained checkpoint weight loading will be nearly identical between CTC and Transducer models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, NeMo makes it seamless to take a config for a CTC ASR model, add in a few components related to Transducers (often without any modifications) and use a different class to instantiate a Transducer model!\n",
    "\n",
    "--------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: It is assumed that the previous tutorial - \"Intro-to-Transducers\" has been reviewed, and there is some familiarity with the config components of transducer models.\n"

    "# Preparing the dataset\n",

    "In this tutorial, we will be utilizing the `AN4`dataset - also known as the Alphanumeric dataset, which was collected and published by Carnegie Mellon University. It consists of recordings of people spelling out addresses, names, telephone numbers, etc., one letter or number at a time and their corresponding transcripts. We choose to use AN4 for this tutorial because it is relatively small, with 948 training and 130 test utterances, and so it trains quickly.\n",
